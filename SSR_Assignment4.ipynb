He\\nannounced after his meeting that Chirac had told him the\\ngovernment would spend two billion francs on a series of\\nmeasures to boost employment and training\\n    Andre Bergeron, a widely respected leader of the moderate\\nForce Ouvriere labour group, put similar demands to Chirac\\nearlier in the week while the Communist-led CGT, the largest of\\nFrance\\'s unions, declared the defence of its members earnings\\nits top priority.\\n    But with unemployment nearing 11 per cent last month, and\\nstill rising, government supporters and some economic analysts\\nsaid they were confident Chirac could resist union pay demands.\\n    \"Salary indexation was ended by the previous Socialist\\ngovernment and I dont think this administration is going to\\nreverse that,\" commented Michel Develle, economist at\\nrecently-privatised Banque Paribas.\\n    Damaging transport and electricity strikes over Christmas\\nand the New Year, partly blamed by the government for higher\\ninflation, had undermined the unions power and popularity, he\\nsaid.\\n    Develle said Paribas expected inflation to rise even more\\nthan the governments revised forecast, perhaps to 2.6 or 2.7\\nper cent this year against last years 2.1 per cent.\\n    \"But that would still be an exceptional achievement\\nconsidering that for the first time since the Second World War\\nall french prices have been freed,\" he commented.\\n    Finance Ministry officials said that the governments\\nabolition of price and rent controls last year was responsible\\nfor nearly a quarter of a 0.9 per cent surge in January living\\ncosts.\\n    But they claimed it was a once-off phenomenon that should\\nhave no knock-on impact on the rest of the year.\\n    Both Marais and Develle said they agreed with that, so long\\nas the government kept wages under control.\\n    Prices could rise 1.5 per cent in the first three months of\\n1987 and two per cent in the first half year, fractionally more\\nthan forecast this week by the National Statistics Institute,\\nINSEE,  Marais said.

Reserves were reported to have\\ndropped below four billion dlrs.\\n    Funaro envisaged that any eventual solution to problems\\nwith Brazil\\'s 108 billion dlr foreign debt would involve only\\npartial servicing of the debt.\\n    \"What we propose is to arrive at a mechanism of refinance\\nfor part of the service, because we cannot service all that,\" he\\nsaid. \"I really think we have to change the old rules.\"\\n    Asked why Brazil was first approaching governments, rather\\nthan the commercial banks themselves in its search for a\\nsolution to the crisis, Funaro said \"We must first talk to the\\ngovernments and then we can talk to the banks, because the\\nbanks have some limits.\"\\n    \"It is a political discussion from our point of view,\" he\\nsaid.\\n    Funaro said he hoped next week to travel to talk to\\nJapanese and Canadian government officials.

Finance from official lending agencies had been virtually\\nclosed since 1982. \"You must open these mechanisms,\" he said.\\n    He said that while the U.S. Officials had been disturbed by\\nBrazil\\'s suspension of interest payments, they understood\\nBrazil had no other choice, as it had to protect its reserves.\\n    Also the financing mechanisms had to be discussed \"because\\nwe can\\'t stay as we were the last few years.\"\\n    \"I\\'m trying to put the problem on the table....

This compares with a target range of 120 to 140 cents\\na lb under the system operating before quotas were suspended in\\nFebruary last year following a sharp rise in international\\nprices caused by drought damage to the Brazilian crop.\\n    In a Reuter interview, Brazilian Coffee Institute, IBC,\\nPresident Jorio Dauster urged producers not to panic and said\\nthey need to make hard commercial decisions. \"If we have failed\\nat the ICO, at least we have tried,\" Dauster said, adding \"now it\\nis time to go and sell coffee.\"\\n    But Brazil is keeping its marketing options open. It plans\\nto make an official estimate of the forthcoming crop next\\nmonth, Dauster said. It is too difficult to forecast now. Trade\\nsources have put the crop at over 26 mln bags compared with a\\nprevious crop of 11.2 mln. Brazil is defining details of public\\nselling tenders for coffee bought on London\\'s futures market\\nlast year.\\n    A basic condition will be that it does not go back to the\\nmarket \"in one go\" but is sold over a minimum of six months.\\n    The breakdown of the ICO negotiations reflected a split\\nbetween producers and consumers on how to set the yardstick for\\nfuture quotas. Consumers said \"objective criteria\" like average\\nexports and stocks should determine producer quota shares,\\nDauster said.\\n    All elements of this proposal were open to negotiation but\\nconsumers insisted they did not want a return to the \"ad hoc\" way\\nof settling export quotas by virtual horse trading amongst\\nproducers whilst consumers waited in the corridors of the ICO.\\n    Dauster said stocks and exports to ICO members and\\nnon-members all need to be considered when setting quotas and\\nthat Brazil would like to apply the coffee pact with a set\\nratio of overall quota reflecting stock holdings.\\n    It is a \"simplistic misconception that Brazil can dictate\"\\npolicy to other producers. While consumer countries are welcome\\nto participate they cannot dictate quotas which are very\\ndifficult to allocate as different \"objective criteria\" achieve\\ndifferent share-outs of quota, Dauster said.\\n    Other delegates said there was more open talking at the ICO\\nand at least differences were not hidden by a bad compromise.\\n    Consumer delegates said they had not been prepared to\\naccept the producers\\' offer to abandon quotas if it proves\\nimpossible to find an acceptable basis for them.\\n    \"We want the basis of quotas to reflect availability and to\\nencourage stock holding as an alternative to a buffer stock if\\nsupplies are needed at a later stage,\" one delegate said.\\n    Some consumers claimed producer support for the consumer\\nargument was gaining momentum towards the end of the ICO\\nsession but said it is uncertain whether this will now collapse\\nand how much producers will sink their differences should\\nprices fall further and remain depressed.\\n    The ICO executive board meets here March 30 to April 1 but\\nboth producer and consumer delegates said they doubt if real\\nnegotiations will begin then. The board is due to meet in\\nIndonesia in June with a full council scheduled for September.\\n    More cynical traders said the pressure of market forces and\\npolitics in debt heavy Latin American producer countries could\\nbring ICO members back around the negotiating table sooner than\\nmany imagine. In that case quotas could come into force during\\nthe summer. But most delegates and traders said quotas before\\nOctober are unlikely, while Brazil\\'s Dauster noted the ICO has\\ncontinued although there were no quotas from 1972 to 1980.\\n    A clear difference between the pressures already being felt\\nby importers and exporters was that consumers would have been\\nhappy to agree on a formula for future quotas even if it could\\nnot be imposed now. At least in that way they said they could\\nshow a direct relationship between quotas and availability.\\n    In contrast producers wanted stop-gap quotas to plug the\\nseemingly bottomless market and were prepared to allow these to\\nlapse should lasting agreement not be found.\\n    \"Producers were offering us jam tomorrow but after their\\nfailure to discuss them last year promises were insufficient\\nand we wanted a cast iron commitment now,\" one consumer said.\\n Reuter\\n'},\n",

A source\\nclose to the management side insisted that timing was on his\\nside. He said if outside directors approve the management\\nproposal, a merger plan could be put to a vote of shareholders\\nwith proxy material going out late this week. \"It would take 20\\ndays from the day we mail,\" said the source.\\n    The source predicted National Amusements, controlled by\\ninvestor Sumner Redstone, would need \"half a year\" to complete\\na tender offer because of the regulatory approvals that must\\naccompany any change in control of Viacom\\'s broadcast licenses\\nand cable television franchises.\\n    Redstone was not available for comment.\\n    Some of Wall Street\\'s arbitrage players said it was a rare\\nsituation that could only be enjoyed - a true bidding war. One\\nsaid Redstone could begin a tender offer whenever he wanted and\\nif enough people were convinced his proposal was superior to\\nthe Viacom management plan, he would have a chance to win.\\n    The independent directors of Viacom were called into a\\nmeeting today. Word on a decision was expected early tomorrow.\\n    Viacom shares climbed 2-1/2 to 50-3/8 by midafternoon. One\\nmajor Wall Street firm issued a sell recommendation. \"We think\\nwe\\'re at the end now, in terms of bidding,\" said the firm\\'s\\narbitrageur, who spoke on condition he not be identified.\\n    Both Redstone\\'s proposal and the management proposal would\\ncreate a restructured company heavily leveraged with debt. The\\nmanagement plan would result in a balance sheet with about 2.5\\nbillion dlrs in debt and nearly 500 mln dlrs in preferred\\nstock, convertible into 45 pct of the common stock.\\n    Redstone\\'s newest proposal offers holders 42 dlrs in cash,\\na fraction of a share of exchangeable preferred stock with a\\nvalue of 7.50 dlrs, and one-fifth of a share of common stock\\nstock of Arsenal Holdings, representing 20 pct of the equity\\ninterest in the restructured Viacom. One arbitrageur calculated\\nthe equity in the Redstone plan was worth 2.50 dlrs making the\\ntotal package worth 52 dlrs per share.\\n    Management offered 38.50 dlrs in cash, exchangeable\\npreferred stock worth 8.50 dlrs and a fractional share of\\nconvertible preferred. The arbitrageur said the equity portion\\nwas worth about 4.00 dlrs for a total of 51 dlrs.\\n    Redstone\\'s newest plan raised the amount of interest he\\nwould pay on the cash portion of his offer for every day beyond\\nApril 30 that a merger with Arsenal is not consummated. The\\nplan calls for intest to be paid at an annual rate of nine pct\\nduring May and 12 pct thereafter. Previously Redstone offered\\neight pct interest.\\n    Other arbitrageurs said both Redstone and the management\\ngroup, led by president and chief executive Terrence Elkes,\\nwere offering high prices. \"Redstone really wants to own the\\ncompany,\" one said. Another said management seemed to have the\\nedge on the timing issue.\\n    Redstone\\'s company owns 19.6 pct ov Viacom\\'s 35 mln shares.\\n    A Wall Street analyst said it was hard to determine what\\nthe equity in the newly leveraged company would be worth.

This compares with a target range of 120 to 140 cents\\na lb under the system operating before quotas were suspended in\\nFebruary last year following a sharp rise in international\\nprices caused by drought damage to the Brazilian crop.\\n    In a Reuter interview, Brazilian Coffee Institute, IBC,\\nPresident Jorio Dauster urged producers not to panic and said\\nthey need to make hard commercial decisions. \"If we have failed\\nat the ICO, at least we have tried,\" Dauster said, adding \"now it\\nis time to go and sell coffee.\"\\n    But Brazil is keeping its marketing options open.

Brazil is defining details of public\\nselling tenders for coffee bought on London\\'s futures market\\nlast year.\\n    A basic condition will be that it does not go back to the\\nmarket \"in one go\" but is sold over a minimum of six months.\\n    The breakdown of the ICO negotiations reflected a split\\nbetween producers and consumers on how to set the yardstick for\\nfuture quotas. Consumers said \"objective criteria\" like average\\nexports and stocks should determine producer quota shares,\\nDauster said.\\n    All elements of this proposal were open to negotiation but\\nconsumers insisted they did not want a return to the \"ad hoc\" way\\nof settling export quotas by virtual horse trading amongst\\nproducers whilst consumers waited in the corridors of the ICO.\\n    Dauster said stocks and exports to ICO members and\\nnon-members all need to be considered when setting quotas and\\nthat Brazil would like to apply the coffee pact with a set\\nratio of overall quota reflecting stock holdings.\\n    It is a \"simplistic misconception that Brazil can dictate\"\\npolicy to other producers. While consumer countries are welcome\\nto participate they cannot dictate quotas which are very\\ndifficult to allocate as different \"objective criteria\" achieve\\ndifferent share-outs of quota, Dauster said.\\n    Other delegates said there was more open talking at the ICO\\nand at least differences were not hidden by a bad compromise.\\n    Consumer delegates said they had not been prepared to\\naccept the producers\\' offer to abandon quotas if it proves\\nimpossible to find an acceptable basis for them.\\n    \"We want the basis of quotas to reflect availability and to\\nencourage stock holding as an alternative to a buffer stock if\\nsupplies are needed at a later stage,\" one delegate said.\\n    Some consumers claimed producer support for the consumer\\nargument was gaining momentum towards the end of the ICO\\nsession but said it is uncertain whether this will now collapse\\nand how much producers will sink their differences should\\nprices fall further and remain depressed.\\n    The ICO executive board meets here March 30 to April 1 but\\nboth producer and consumer delegates said they doubt if real\\nnegotiations will begin then. The board is due to meet in\\nIndonesia in June with a full council scheduled for September.\\n    More cynical traders said the pressure of market forces and\\npolitics in debt heavy Latin American producer countries could\\nbring ICO members back around the negotiating table sooner than\\nmany imagine. In that case quotas could come into force during\\nthe summer.

I think there\\'s a major\\nearnings surprise in the winds,\" he said.\\n    Kirnan raised his earnings estimates slightly today, in\\npart in reaction to the announced buyback, and sees GM earning\\n5.65 dlrs this year and 9.75 dlrs in 1988. \"The company is more\\nconcerned than ever about improving their relative valuation\\nwith respect to Ford and Chrysler,\" he said.\\n    Another positive for the stock is GM\\'s dividend, currently\\nfive dlrs a share annually, which gives it a higher yield than\\nits competitors, Kirnan said.

Suddenly, instead of the U.S., It is Europe that is\\nlaying the golden egg,\" said de Hora.\\n    The EC is worried. EC business also had a remarkable year\\nin Japanese sales, but this can be explained partly due to its\\nstart from a small base, compared with total Japan-U.S. Trade.\\n    The Japanese think EC firms are now more competitive than\\nU.S. Firms, a factor which is aggravating the exchange rate\\nimbalance, and which will cause problems.\\n    \"This currency alignment between Japan and the EC is\\nreflecting the excellent performance of the EC countries.

The\\nplan calls for intest to be paid at an annual rate of nine pct\\nduring May and 12 pct thereafter.

Analysts\\nagreed that investors liked the repurchase program but they \\ndiffered sharply over the carmaker\\'s long term prospects.\\n    \"I\\'m very positive on GM,\" said Jack Kirnan of Kidder\\nPeabody and Co. \"They\\'re clearly committed to enhancing\\nshareholder value.\"\\n    However, some analysts worry about how GM will pay for the\\nbuyback and whether new models will enable the carmaker to\\nrecapture lost market share.\\n    After the market had closed yesterday, GM said it would buy\\nback 20 pct of its common stock by the end of 1990. The\\nannouncement sent investors today scrambling for GM shares,\\nwith more than 3.2 mln shares changing hands by mid-day.\\n    The buyback plan caused several analysts bullish on the\\nstock to reiterate buy recommendations this morning, and at\\nleast one increased his earnings estimates for GM based on a\\ngood performance expected from new car models.\\n    But David Healy of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc said the\\nrepurchase program is not a positive.\\n    \"The buyback doesn\\'t really change the earnings outlook and\\nputs more stress on the balance sheet,\" he said, since GM will\\nhave to borrow money to pay for the stock purchases.

Federal\\nReserve Board Governor Martha Seger, following approval of the\\nproposed guidelines by the Fed, said she is concerned that\\nJapan was not involved in the U.K.-U.S. effort to draft new\\ncapital rules.\\n     Dealers said they were somewhat relieved to see that bank\\nregulators recognized the concept of netting, that is,\\noffsetting the amounts receiveable from and payable to a single\\ncounterparty against each other.\\n    The paper said that regulatory authorities \"recognize that\\nsuch arrangements (netting) may in certain circumstances reduce\\ncredit risk.\" Furthermore, the paper said, if a netting\\nagreement could be reached that would withstand legal tests, it\\nmight be willing to reduce capital requirements accordingly.\\n    But dealers said they fear regulators may insist on an\\nairtight netting agreement that is impossible to design.\\n     \"One problem is that there has never been a major default\\nin the swaps market. So we don\\'t know if any of the swap\\narrangements will really stand up in court,\" said one bank\\nofficial.\\n Reuter\\n'},\n",

Suddenly, instead of the U.S., It is Europe that is\\nlaying the golden egg,\" said de Hora.\\n    The EC is worried. EC business also had a remarkable year\\nin Japanese sales, but this can be explained partly due to its\\nstart from a small base, compared with total Japan-U.S. Trade.\\n    The Japanese think EC firms are now more competitive than\\nU.S. Firms, a factor which is aggravating the exchange rate\\nimbalance, and which will cause problems.\\n    \"This currency alignment between Japan and the EC is\\nreflecting the excellent performance of the EC countries.

The decrease in\\nU.S. Earnings had been accentuated by tax rates but the group\\nhad increased share to become volume market leader, Holmes\\nadded.\\n    Continued low crude oil prices would continue to subdue\\nU.S. Exploration activity. \"Exploration is currently pretty\\nflat.

The agreement\\nsimply helped it on its way. Senior EC financial expert in\\nTokyo Tomas de Hora has watched the movements closely.\\n    \"You have to look at the dollar\\'s peak compared with now,\\nand that was well before Plaza,\" he said.\\n    On February 25, 1985, the dollar peaked against the yen at\\n263.15 yen. On September 20, the Friday before Plaza, it was\\n242. Since then, despite massive Bank of Japan intervention and\\nperiodic market frights about further G-5 concerted action, the\\ndollar trend has been down, down, down.\\n    Yet the ECU is now around 173.4 yen. The historical cross\\nrates for sterling and the mark tell much the same story. The\\nEuropean currencies are moving back up against the yen.\\n    The close relationship between exchange rates and trade\\nflows makes it difficult to see which is driving which, but\\nundoubtedly the trade equation between the big three is\\nchanging. In 1986, Japanese imports and exports with the EC\\nboth grew by around 50 pct in dollar terms, five pct in yen.\\nThis gave Japan a 16 billion dlr trade surplus.\\n    Last January, Japanese exports to the EC totalled half of\\nof sales to the U.S, against about a third in recent years.\\n    Trade with the U.S in 1986 rose 23 pct for exports and 12\\npct for imports in dollar terms, but fell 13 pct for exports\\nand 21 pct for imports in yen terms.\\n    \"The basic meaning for Europe is that Japanese firms have a\\ntremendous interest in exporting to Europe, where every unit\\nsold maximises profits in yen terms, which is what is important\\nto them. Suddenly, instead of the U.S., It is Europe that is\\nlaying the golden egg,\" said de Hora.\\n    The EC is worried. EC business also had a remarkable year\\nin Japanese sales, but this can be explained partly due to its\\nstart from a small base, compared with total Japan-U.S. Trade.\\n    The Japanese think EC firms are now more competitive than\\nU.S. Firms, a factor which is aggravating the exchange rate\\nimbalance, and which will cause problems.\\n    \"This currency alignment between Japan and the EC is\\nreflecting the excellent performance of the EC countries.

A\\nconflicting floor vote delayed the start of the meeting, and\\nstaffers said it may have to be delayed even until next week.\\n    Such a delay would not bode well for proponents of an\\nexpanded 0/92 program, since spring planting in many areas of\\nthe country will be underway in the next few weeks and signup\\nfor the 1987 wheat and feedgrains program ends March 30.\\n    Farmers are now making their planting decisions, so\\nsomething has to be done quickly if a 0/92 program is to be\\nimplemented, an Agriculture Department source said.\\n    An expansion of 0/92 to feedgrains was opposed in last\\nweek\\'s subcommittee hearing on the bill, with subcommittee\\nchairman Dan Glickman, D-Kan., saying that more study of the\\nconsequences of decoupling on feedgrains plantings was\\nnecessary.\\n    Major commodity groups, including the National Corn\\nGrowers, the American Farm Bureau and the National Cattlemen\\'s\\nAssociation, have voiced strong opposition to 0/92.\\n    But proponents of an expanded 0/92 argue that the bill\\ncurrently is not equitable for all grains producers, so it\\nshould be extended to other crops.\\n    There will be difficulty in limiting 0/92 to wheat, said\\nGene Moos, aide to house majority leader Tom Foley, D-Wash.\\n    Projected cost savings, in the current atmosphere of try to\\ndecrease farm expenditures, would also be hard to ignore in the\\ndebate to expand the 0/92 application, Moos said.\\n    Rep. Charles Stenholm, D-Tex., may be planning to introduce\\na bill to restrict 0/92 to only 1987 crop wheat, with the\\nargument that now is not the time to vote in favor of any major\\nchanges in the farm bill.\\n    \"Stenholm\\'s bill is not a rejection of 0/92, only of the\\ntiming,\" a congressional staff member said.\\n    Rep. Arland Stangeland (R-Minn.) is reported to have an\\namendment to expand the 0/92 provision to 1987 and 1988\\nfeedgrains.\\n Reuter\\n'},\n",

The move complicated a USAir\\ntakeover offer for Piedmont, which was believed to be close to\\naccepting the bid.\\n    Today, USAir rejected Icahn\\'s 52 dlr per share offer and\\nsaid the bid was a last-minute effort to interfere in its\\ntakeover of Piedmont. Icahn was unavailable for comment.\\n    Piedmont fell one to 68-5/8 on volume of 963,000. TWA was\\noff 3/8 to 31-1/2. USAir fell 1-3/8 to 47-3/4 as doubt spread\\nit would be taken over.\\n    Analysts and market sources view the TWA bid as an attempt\\nto either trigger a counter offer from USAir or to attract a\\nsuitor who might want both airlines once they merged.\\n   \"The next move is either Icahn starts a tender offer or\\nPiedmont and USAir announce a deal,\" speculated one arbitrager.\\n    Some arbitragers said there is now some risk in the current\\nprice of Piedmont since it is not clear that USAir\\'s bid will\\nsucceed.\\n    Piedmont\\'s largest shareholder and other suitor, Norfolk\\nSouthern Corp &lt;NSC> has offered 65 dlrs per share for the\\ncompany. USAir offered 71 dlrs cash per share for half of\\nPiedmont stock, and 73 dlrs per share in stock for the balance.\\n    Some arbitragers, however, believe the depressed price of\\nPiedmont offers a buying opportunity since the airline is\\ndestined to be acquired by someone. USAir, they said, is the\\nleast likely to be bought.\\n    Icahn, who has long talked about further consolidation in\\nthe airline industry, also offered USAir the alternative of a\\nthree-way airline combination, including TWA and Piedmont.\\n    But Wall Street has given little credibility to Icahn\\'s\\noffer, which lacked financing and was riddled with\\ncontingencies.\\n    Still, he has succeeded in holding up a merger of two\\nairlines - both of which analysts said would fit well with TWA.\\n    \"You can\\'t discount him,\" said one arbitrager.\\n    Analysts, however, said Icahn would have to prove he is\\nserious by following through with his threats or making a new\\noffer. In making the offer for USAir, Icahn threatened to go\\ndirectly to shareholders for 51 pct of the stock at a lower\\nprice if USAir rejected his offer.\\n    \"It\\'s clear Icahn wants to sell and he\\'s bluffing,\" said\\none arbitrager.\\n    Analysts said the 52 dlr per share offer was underpriced by\\nabout six dlrs per share.\\n    Some analysts believe Icahn\\'s proposed three-way airline\\ncombination might face insurmountable regulatory hurdles, but\\nothers believe it could be cleared if the companies are\\nacquired separately.\\n    \"TWA would have to be the surviving company for the deal to\\nwork,\" said one analyst.\\n    Analysts said such a merger would be costly and\\ncomplicated. TWA has the best cost structure, since Icahn\\nsucceeded in winning concessions from its unions.\\n    In order for the other carriers to come down to TWA\\'s wage\\nscale in a merger, TWA would have to be the surviving entity,\\nanalysts said.\\n    Such a move does not necessarily free Icahn of TWA, they\\nsaid. They said he showed skill in reducing Ozark Airlines\\'\\ncosts when he merged it into TWA last year, and he might be a\\nnecessary ingredient for a merger to work.\\n    However, other analysts speculated the managements of\\nPiedmont and USAir would not tolerate Icahn as head of a new\\ncompany.
